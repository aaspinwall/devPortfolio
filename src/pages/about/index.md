###My quick story

**I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years old**. Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites where I could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. Later the game changed and the cool stuff was made with Dreamweaver, so I used it to make fan-club websites for my favourite music artist. When social media came around I was making myspace websites look stunning (15 year old me thought so) with my sick coding skills.

**Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.** I've been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

In the last few years I've been increasingly working on software development in my professional life. I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.

###As a developer

I pay close **attention to my code’s readability**. Sure, I’ll put together something as quickly as possible to make it work, but after that I’ll spend a good amount of time commenting and organizing everything. _Mi casa es tu casa_, I want you to **feel welcome around my code.**

**Clean, consistent, readable and maintainable code.** It’s great when features work, but it’s even greater whenever they can stay that way, regardless of who’s working on them.

I’m excited to work on new projects with new people. I learn something new every time and I’m excited for the next challenge.

###As a person

If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be **resourceful**. I’ll take a problem, break it into smaller bits and MacGyver myself a solution. Creativity has helped me sail around tough obstacles.

**I’m curious by nature and I love learning**. I’ve amassed a wide range of skills and interests that when put together, end up feeding my career in one way or another. I’m what they call a T-shaped individual.

###As a colleague
I’m a team player, with my background in engineering and art, I feel comfortable interacting with both the technically oriented people of the team as well as the artistically oriented ones.

My communications skills are excellent. I’ve worked on the side as a teacher for ten years. This experience has made me better at conveying ideas in creative ways. Everyone has a different background, hence everyone has a unique style of communication. I try my best to find what’s most effective. I’m also fluent in business communication, I know that good interpersonal connections can help move projects into fruition.

I’m always happy to pull an espresso shot and make some latte art for a colleague. I love to cook, so be on the lookout for the next potluck.
