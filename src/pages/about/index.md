My name is Alejandro Aspinwall.

I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years old. Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites were I could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. Later the game changed and the cool stuff was made with Dreamweaver, so I used it make fan-club websites for my favourite music artist. When social media came around I was making myspace websites look stunning (15 year old me thought so) with my sick coding skills. 

Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating. I've been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

In the last few years, I've been increasingly working on software development tasks in my professional life. But most recently I came back to my first love, **The web** üåê, it can do everything nowadays!

Most of the tools I came to know and love are not around anymore. But my passion and excitement for building cool stuff hasn't changed a bit.
