# Project Purpose and Goal

Gleefactor is a work culture management firm that helps organizations transform their cultures by enabling teams to adopt and activate new behaviours through play. **The goal was to create a fast website that would drive conversions** from social media and search engine traffic.

The company had to pivot away from in-person events and quickly build an online platform that would be able to handle a growing number of uniquely built products. This posed a challenge for their Wordpress based infrastructure.

# Web Stack and Explanation

I chose a server side rendered site that would load from a CDN to achieve the fastest loading times. **I chose Gatsby for the static page generation because their Wordpress plugin is second to none.**

**This function is created on demand whenever a new user subscribes to the mailing list.** The API keys are stored using environment variables and are as safe as if they were running on an external server.

# Lessons Learned

I worked with WP many years ago, before I got into modern javascript based frameworks. I think the technology works very well for some organizations, especially ones that have a lot of content and not many features. **This project called for a flexible solution that would scale to fit the needs of the company's growth**. Moving the whole site away from WP would've been my choice but the client's requests made me re-evaluate the solutions. In the end, I'm very satisfied with the result!
