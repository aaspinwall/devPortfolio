Being part of Prof G's brand strategy sprint has been a unique experience from day one. It's been a huge opportunity to meet people from very diverse backgrounds. We come together because we're embracing change and want \_\_

On the first day of the sprint we were added to the Slack workspace. Here we were greeted by the awesome TAs and admins that would help us through the course. There was a channel called #networking where the welcome message was. "Share a quick intro about who you are, what you do, and why youâ€™re here." I quickly realized that there were over a thousand participants on the community!

I was ecstatic to meet so many leaders and I wanted to learn more. Unfortunately, in matter of hours it was impossible to keep up with the messages. There where more than 500 messages posted in the #networking channel within the span of 24 hours.

Fun fact, it would take an average reader 2.8 hours to go through every message. I wanted to understand the group a bit better, or at least be able to get an overview of what was going on. Luckily, machines are really good at processing data.

We crunched the numbers and came up with some very interesting results.

Although we're over 1,100 sprinters in the channel, less than half of us wrote an introduction. We found 482 posts, where the average length was 448 words.

If you're struggling to imagine how that looks like. That's about 1.6 tweets.

Words

The top 5 words were: excited, love, creative, great and help. Awesome energy from the start! Here is the rest of the words that appeared more than 16 times.

Sentiment

Next, I wanted to get a feel for the mood of the group. We ran a sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) based on the words we used to describe ourselves.

Warning! nerd talk ahead: Some words which are associated with positive/negative emotions are ranked between -5 and +5 (0 is neutral). We call this the AFINN score.

For example, let's imagine an incredibly "positive" blurb with 50 words, where each one has an AFINN score of 5. Our result would look like this:

(max positive score _ number of words) / number of words
(5 _ 50) / 50 = 5

Talk after lunch?

Intuitively, I thought that most people would participate in conversations sometime after lunch. I realized that the cohort was composed of people from all over the world. Lunchtime could be dinner time for somebody else. After running the numbers, we can see that the universal talk time for international business people is...
