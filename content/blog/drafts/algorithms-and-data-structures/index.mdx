## My roadmap

What are data structures?

Different ways of sorting data on a computer

Gayle recommends: "For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable,
the space and time complexity."

### References

[Tren Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9cEqFynHU) gives an incredibly fast overview of both data structures and algorithms. Watch this video once and take it as a "trailer" of the subject. Study each subject and go back to this video periodically. Stuff will make sense slowly as you progress.

[Nick White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-ubSA9GA3o&feature=emb_logo) talks about why it's important to know data structures and basic algorithms to be able to solve leetcode problems.
