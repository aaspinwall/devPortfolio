**Before**\
My Javascript fundamentals were okay but I struggled mostly with destructuring. Create React App was my one and only solution, I used Redux whenever I felt that props had to go somewhere beyond direct children and I was very new to React Hooks. Finally, I was struggling with structuring data in databases.\
\
**After**\
During the 100 days, I landed a few freelance gigs. Having an active presence on Twitter \

**Pros**

* Tracking my progress
* Keep myself accountable

**Cons**\
Twitter is still social media. My very first post had 120 views and I was thrilled! After a few weeks, posts that got 

### **New skills**

**React**\
**When I look back at the code I was writing at the beginning of the year, I get a headache.** I was using global states for no apparent reason and that made things awfully complicated. Thanks to Sara Vieira's book **Opinionated Guide to React**, I learned some great insights into organizing code and making more **re-usable components**. I actually forced myself to refactor a full application after reading the book.

**Gatsby**\
I've built almost everything during these 100 days using Gatsby. 

**Wordpress**\
ðŸŽƒ  I had heard spooky tales about working with Wordpress and having to deal with the dreaded PHP. But nobody tells you that every project is different and you might find ðŸ•¸  even spookier things... like a huge plugin mess! ðŸ‘»  I guess this story deserves a whole blog post, but the conclusion is that I'm not afraid of Wordpress anymore. I was able to tame the beast by turning it into a headless CMS using Gatsby.

**GraphQL**\
Here I go again, I swear I'm not getting paid by them. Gatsby forces you to use GraphQL from the start and makes it easy to understand what you're doing by using GraphiQL. It did take me a while to get comfortable with all the terminology but I'm glad I stuck with it. It's worth it!\
\
**AWS**\
I tried working with AWS for the first time in 2015 and it didn't go well. Back then my only resource was early [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and the AWS documentation. I failed miserably and moved to Digital Ocean. \
This time around, my in was the **\#CloudResumeChallenge** that [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) recommended me.

**What lies ahead**

**200 days? I don't think so**\
\
Honestly, it has been tough. Maybe it's because of the approach that I took or because stuff has been crazy this year in general. I felt that I needed to produce something visibly interesting every day and get at least one win a week.
