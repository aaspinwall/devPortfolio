Hi!

Thanks for dropping by. Here is a bit of context.

I want to make a commitment with myself that I'll post at least one blog entry per week. The fact is that I work every day on various projects but rarely finish a week with some sense of completion. I guess the best way to fix this is to publish what I've been up to and eventually figure out something useful to share with the world. What is this? Some sort of documental archive? Well maybe it is...
